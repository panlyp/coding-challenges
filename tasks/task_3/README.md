# Task 3: Sugar Dealer - backend

### Mission 1
  As a beginner in API validation I referenced heavily from Joi's documentation. 
  - The modifications can be found in `product.validation.js` and `productStock.validation.js`.
  - **Bonus**: Applying validations rule to Product & ProductStock API routes - updates in `product.route.js` and `productStock.route.js` under `routes/v1`.

Tests are done by using the Paw app: [see list](paw.png)

### Mission 2
  - The filtering logic is added in the listing API in `product.controller.js`.
  - My approach is to compare the value in query with that from the product. 

### Mission 3 (In progress)
