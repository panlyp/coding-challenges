# Task 3: Sugar Dealer - backend

### Mission 1
  As a beginner in API validation I referenced heavily from Joi's documentation. 
  - The modifications can be found in `product.validation.js` and `productStock.validation.js`.
  - **Bonus**: Applying validations rule to Product & ProductStock API routes - updates in `product.route.js` and `productStock.route.js` under `routes/v1`.

Tests are done by using the Paw app: [see list](paw.png)

### Mission 2
  - 
  - **Bonus**: Allow filtering both `isAvailable` and `isExpired` for a single api call.


### Mission 3
  - **Bonus**: Group the summary results by color.
